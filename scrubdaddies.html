 <p>I love scrub daddies so much. I first saw that smiling face on Shark Tank, where THE scrub daddy introduced them to the world. I was enticed by the gaze of that yellow sponge and knew I must have one from that point on. </p>
 <p>Today, there are many different Scrub Daddy products. I will go through most of them and highlight my favorites </p>
